# Computer Generated Faces

### it is possible to use it with pretrained data or you can train it from scratch

# Installation
- use requirements file in order to download required libraries
- link provided for dataset please check data folder and use dataset_editor script for preparing dataset

# Results
### In order to get these kind footages i trained network 200 epochs and it took around ~40 minutes on colab (1xTesla T4 16GB, Intel Xeon R 12GB)
### But after 5 epoch it is possible to see reasonable outputs
### for more footages please check results folder
